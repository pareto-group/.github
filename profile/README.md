## PARETO group
Based in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Maryland, College Park

Welcome! We focus on Predictability and Applied Research for the Earth-system with Training and Optimization (PARETO). As such, we use machine learning (e.g., neural networks) and numerical modeling systems (e.g., CESM) to answer pressing questions and address challenges in modeling the Earth system.
